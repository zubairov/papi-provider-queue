This is a simple example on how to create the SOPERA Provider that is handling requests
within a single Thread.

In SOPERA PAPI we have a limitation that once MessageHandler recieved a message it should read and respond
to it in the same thread.  This limitation could be avoided by using the QueuedMessageHandler class.

See example inside org.sopera.talend.test.TestProviderQueue.

Basically I can add teh most usefull feature! :-)
